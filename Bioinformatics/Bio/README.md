# Final Project Description
This is my final project in the ["Bioinformatics Algorithms"](http://sharif.edu/~koohi/Teaching/Teaching.htm) course. 

The project is about genome comparison and it is based on [CAFE: aCcelerated Alignment-FrEe sequence analysis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5793812/)  

**Phase 1:** Presentation

**Phase 2:**
